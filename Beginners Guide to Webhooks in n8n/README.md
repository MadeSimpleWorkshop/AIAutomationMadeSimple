Video Title: Beginners Guide to Webhooks in n8n (Explained Step-by-Step)

Video Details:

Let’s build your first webhook in n8n. We’ll create an endpoint you can send data to from a website or app, then turn that data into an automation workflow.

In this step-by-step beginner tutorial, you’ll learn webhooks in n8n in the simplest way possible — including GET vs POST, how to test webhooks from a web browser + web form, how to use Respond to Webhook, and how to secure your workflows with Basic Auth and Header Auth.

By the end, you’ll understand how webhooks let apps “talk to each other” and how to build a real end-to-end automation in n8n — from receiving data to sending an email and returning a clean response.

✅ Includes: webhook setup, testing, request data breakdown, and returning a response.
