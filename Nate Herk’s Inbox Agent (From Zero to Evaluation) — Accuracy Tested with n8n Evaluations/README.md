This #n8n automation accuracy testing video launches a new series focused on accuracy testing with n8n Evaluations.

In this first episode, I independently evaluate Nate Herk’s Inbox Agent, measuring Inbox Agent accuracy from zero to evaluation using a structured automation evaluation framework built in #n8n.

Rather than a tutorial or walkthrough, this video focuses on automation accuracy testing, AI agent evaluation, and real-world automation performance. The Inbox Agent is tested against golden datasets (where accuracy should approach 100%) and messy real-world email data that exposes automation edge cases.

What’s covered in this episode:
* What accuracy testing for automations means in practice
* How to evaluate AI agents and n8n workflows
* Baseline accuracy results using golden test data
* Accuracy results using real-world email data
* How automation edge cases impact classification accuracy
* How n8n Evaluations can be used to build reproducible automation scorecards

The goal of this series is to help builders move beyond demos and hype and toward production-ready n8n automations using transparent, measurable accuracy testing.

This video is an independent technical evaluation. There is no affiliation with Nate Herk or endorsement implied.

🔁 About the Accuracy Tested Series

The Accuracy Tested series evaluates n8n automations, AI agents, and workflow logic using objective criteria, golden data baselines, and real-world inputs so you can understand automation accuracy, reliability, and production readiness.
