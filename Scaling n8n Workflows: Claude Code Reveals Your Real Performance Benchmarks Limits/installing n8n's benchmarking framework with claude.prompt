I need to install and run n8n's benchmarking tool on my Mac.

EXISTING SETUP:
- n8n already running at http://localhost:5678 (Docker Compose)
- Docker Compose file: ~/Development/n8n-compose/docker-compose.yml
- Login: your@email.com / yourpassword

STEPS:
1. Check if I have Node.js 18.10+ and pnpm installed
2. Clone the n8n repository to ~/n8n-benchmark
3. Navigate to packages/@n8n/benchmark
4. Install dependencies with pnpm install
5. Build the benchmark tool with pnpm build
6. List the available benchmark scenarios
7. Run the single-webhook scenario against my EXISTING n8n instance
   - Test with 2, 20, and 50 concurrent connections (30s each)
8. Show results and explain what each metric means
9. Recommend performance optimizations based on results

Document each step. Report any issues in ALL CAPS.
